# Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains various artifacts, such as source code and other materials, that supplement our work on **Unseen Log Anomaly Detection from System Logs**. This work proposes a novel framework for code file anomaly detection from system logs, UnseenLog. The figure below illustrates the overall architecture of UnseenLog. It comprises two key components that work in tandem to enhance the modelâ€™s generalization capability: (1) MinMax strategy; (2) Recurrent Iterative Selection and Enhancement.

# Preliminaries: Getting ready for experiments
>  Package requirements
>>python 3.10+; pytorch 2.1.2+; torch-geometric 2.4.0+
# How to run code from the command line
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zzxhelloworld/UnseenLog.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <your_project_directory>
   ```
3. Run code from the command line for experiments:
   ```bash
